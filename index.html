      <h3>
        Our mission is to help Black communities in need by guiding them towards
        free resources. We help families find food from food pantries, and talk
        about how others can donate to these places. </h3> 
        <h3>Although our mission is primarily to help Black communities, we encourage anyone who needs help
        to use our resources!
      </h3>
      <h3>If you are someone in need of resources, check out our Locations Near You page. Any food bank that registers with us will be added to that page, and you will be able to see what food they have left in stock.</h3>
      <h3>If you are someone who wants to help donate to food banks, we have made it easier than ever for you. On the Donate page, you can see which food banks need which products. This way, food banks will get the products they need at the times they need them.</h3>
      <h3>If you are a food bank or other organization that would like to collaborate with us or have your location and statistics added to our website, don't worry! We will implement a system through which you can update your food bank's location in real time!</h3>
